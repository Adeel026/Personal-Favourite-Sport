                    <p> Football, often referred to as soccer in some regions, is a globally beloved sport that
                        captivates millions of enthusiasts and transcends cultural boundaries. This dynamic and
                        exhilarating game is played between two teams, each consisting of eleven players, on a
                        rectangular field with goals at either end.</p>

                    <p> Baseball, often referred to as America's pastime, is a timeless sport that weaves together
                        strategy, skill, and the thrill of competition. Played on a diamond-shaped field, the game
                        involves two teams taking turns as batters and fielders. The batter's objective is to hit a
                        pitched ball with a rounded bat and then navigate a series of bases arranged in a diamond
                        pattern—first, second, third, and finally, home plate—to score runs.</p>

                    <p> Basketball, a fast-paced and dynamic sport, unfolds on a rectangular court with the objective of
                        scoring points by shooting a ball through the opponent's basket. Played between two teams of
                        five players each, the game combines athleticism, teamwork, and strategic finesse. </p>

                        Tennis, a sport that blends elegance with athleticism, is played on a rectangular court divided
                        by a net. It's a game of precision and strategy, where two opponents or teams strive to
                        outmaneuver each other by striking a fuzzy ball back and forth using rackets. The objective is
                        simple yet challenging: score points by landing the ball within the opponent's court boundaries.
